# consoleCord

consoleCord is an application which allows you to use the features of Discord through your console. You can send messages (including DM's) and read messages (including DM's) from anyone/any channel/any server of your choice. More features will be added as I continue to develop this.

Enter the directory where you have downloaded or cloned the repository and run both `read.py` and `send.py` parallelly. 

Features to come:
- Banning
- Kicking
- Nickname changing
- Role assigning
